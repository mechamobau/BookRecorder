-- This is where we define all of the routes in our application. For a full
-- explanation of the syntax, please see:

-- Note that this is really half the story; in Application.hs, mkYesodDispatch
-- generates the rest of the code. Please see the following documentation
-- for an explanation for this split:
-- http://www.yesodweb.com/book/scaffolding-and-the-site-template#scaffolding-and-the-site-template_foundation_and_application_modules

-- This function also generates the following type synonyms:
-- type Handler = HandlerFor App
-- type Widget = WidgetFor App ()
mkYesodData "App" $(parseRoutesFile "config/routes.yesodroutes")

-- | A convenient synonym for database access functions.
type DB a = forall (m :: * -> *).

-- Please see the documentation for the Yesod typeclass. There are a number
-- of settings which can be configured by overriding methods here.
